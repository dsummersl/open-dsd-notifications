## Development Services Department, City of San Diego

For the first time, the City of San Diegoâ€™s Development Services Department (DSD) has released to the public its Project Tracking System (PTS) in web-based format. PTS is an in-house software system used to both manage and track the City's land development permit processing functions.

There are essentially three parts of the system: Code Enforcement, Ministerial Permits, and Discretionary Permits. Code enforcements are primarily complaint-driven, while permits relate to different city projects. Projects can be either Ministerial (i.e. "over the counter" permits like building permits, electrical, and mechanical permits). Discretionary projects require a higher level of review (e.g. neighborhood use/development permit, conditional use permit).


### Code Enforcement

Code Enforcement ([map search](http://opendsd.sandiego.gov/web/maps/cecase)) is primarily complaint driven and consists of complaints, which are entered in the system as `Cases` and assigned a `Case Number` and an `Investigator`. The investigator takes a series of steps, such as sending out an initial notice, investigating the site/research, etc. Various timelines and reminder/follow-up dates are provided for follow-up and action toward correcting the complaint before the case is eventually closed.

#### Dataset ([Information](http://www.sandiego.gov/development-services/opendsd/codenforcement.shtml))

* _CaseId_ -- this would be the Code Enforcement Case ID number
* _CaseDepiction_ -- I'm not sure what this stands for. I'm checking with Jim Myers to see if there is a document that describes all of the field labels.
* _SortableStreetAddress_ -- it looks like this puts the Street Name first, and the street number after so that it can be sorted in a list
* _APN_ -- this is the Assessors Parcel Number
* _Mapreference_ -- I believe this is the Thomas Bros. Map Code

### Ministerial Permits
Ministerial permits ([map search](http://opendsd.sandiego.gov/web/maps/approvalsministerial)) are generally construction permits which are obtained via a staff-level/other-the-counter type decision. These can include things like building permits, right-of-way permits, etc.

### Discretionary Permits
Discretionary permits ([map search](http://opendsd.sandiego.gov/web/maps/approvalsdiscretionary)) consist of projects where a Process 2 or higher decision is required before a construction permit/ministerial permit can be issued.
